Personally, I think #7 (Find a Squad) will be the hardest for me. I’ve been coding as a hobby for years, but always on my own; I’ve never taken a class or worked alongside anyone long-term. Because of that, I never really had anyone I could really connect with – the few people who had any programming experience at all were either far beyond my skill level or not in the same fields as I was. Today, I feel like a little bit of an outsider to the coding world, but I’m hoping I can change that in this program.
